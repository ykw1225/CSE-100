=========================== README PA1 =============================

1. We are using a constant lvalue reference for parameter d in the 
   constructor of BSTNode class because we want to make sure that
   when we assign the value of data to the field of BSTNode object,
   we will not change the original value of parameter.


2. A.The dummy argument int for post-increment operator is used for
     indicating that the increament is postfix increament not a prefix
     increament because these two operator overload function have the
     same function name.

   B.For the pre-increment operator, we want to use the inremented
     BSTIterator; while in the post increment operator case, we want
     to use the BSTIterator before it gets incremented, therefore it
     needs to make a copy of that BSTIterator instead of directly
     using its reference.
